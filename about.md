### Registry

Coming soon.

### Booking a hotel

Our ceremony and reception are both downtown at Palm Door on Sabine. There will be a biker rally in Austin on the same weekend as the wedding, so you might want to reserve a spot sooner rather than later.

### Things to do in Austin


* Get a breakfast taco at El Primo and a coffee from Once Over.

* Visit Farewell Books and Las Cruxes and get a coffee at Flat Track.

* Visit Book People.

* Get a cheeseburger (with extra special sauce) and fries from P. Terry's.

* Go swimming at Barton Springs Pool.

* Walk around South Congress and visit Uncommon Objects and eat a red velvet cupcake from Hey Cupcake!


# <a name="thedayof">The Day Of</a>

Both the ceremony and reception are at Palm Door on Sabine. The ceremony will begin at 5:30pm, followed by a dinner and reception at 6:30pm, with music by Aunt Ruby's Sweet Jazz Babies. Attire is business casual.

Dinner will be provided by Salt Lick BBQ. If you are vegetarian or vegan, please let us know so that we can accomodate you.
